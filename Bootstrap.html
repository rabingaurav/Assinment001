  <p>Photographing Birds – The Cold Hard Truth Birds are difficult to photograph at the best of times. In most cases, it is their call that alludes us to their presence....</p>

    <p>TECHNICAL SETTINGS FOR PHOTOGRAPHING BIRDS
The seven key elements to any successful bird photographs are:

Shooting Mode
Aperture
Shutter Speed
ISO
Drive Mode
Focus Mode
Focus
Yes, I know, I can already hear some of you asking… “Aren’t those key elements a factor for every photograph, irrespective of the subject?” Absolutely! However, dialing in the correct settings to match your vision can be a little trickier. When photographing birds you should first start with a clear idea of how you want to capture your subject. Do you simply want to capture a portrait of your subject? Do you want to separate the bird from its environment? Or is the environment a compositional element? Do you want to capture the bird in flight?</p>

      <p>When photographing birds my initial standard setting is as follows:

Shooting Mode – Shutter Priority
Aperture – Camera automatically selects aperture based on my shutter speed.
Shutter speed – 1/1250
ISO (Auto) – Camera automatically selects ISO to allow 1/1250 shutter speed.
Continuous drive / burst mode
Focus mode AI Servo (Canon)
Back Button Focus
AF Area Mode – Zone selection or any of the expanded area focus selection.
These are my base settings which I have configured as a Custom Shooting Mode. From there, I can quickly make the necessary adjustments to my settings to match my vision for the photograph.</p>
